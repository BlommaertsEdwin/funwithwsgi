    		<h1>Hello world</h1>
    		<h2>What is this?</h2>
    		<p>This is my attempt at getting better with Python web development. It's an exercise in programming and understanding WSGI better.
        I don't have a structured plan or goal with this, it is just me playing around.
    If you are interested, I am tracking and developing this project on <a href="https://github.com/BlommaertsEdwin/funwithwsgi">Github</a>.
        Any ideas comments and project related stuff goes there.</p>
    		<p>This web page will also serve as a place for me to blog and have my own space on the web.</p>
    		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
